## RUST SOKOBAN

This was a learning experience. It is composed of 5 smaller projects that each build on the previous ones. Feel free to point out any places where I could improve!

### 1. guessing

This is a simple guessing game that uses loops and user input.

### 2. sokoban

This is a simple Sokoban implementation using file IO and a simple game loop.

### 3. sokoban v2

Although similar in functionality to #2, this implementation uses `struct` and `impl` which are very key Rust features.

### 4. SDL test

This is just boilerplate code to get SDL working for graphics.

### 5. SDL Sokoban

Here we tie everything together by using the struct from #3 with and the rendering from #4.
